# Helicopter Android Game

First android game that I've made in Android Studio for fun. Followed a couple of different youtube tutorials to get this one running
and borrowed the missile and explosive sprite resources from one of the tuts. This one was a lot of fun to make and the game loop runs quite differently to my java snake game.
